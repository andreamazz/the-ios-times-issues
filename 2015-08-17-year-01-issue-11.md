Assembling the list for this week's issues has been **very hard**. Never before I had seen such a number of interesting projects, both trending and new. I tried to favour variety, and I feel like apologizing to the projects that haven't been highlighted, and their authors, so please have a careful look at the "Other Interesting Projects" at the bottom. Enjoy!

## [Parse-SDK-iOS-OSX](https://github.com/ParsePlatform/Parse-SDK-iOS-OSX)

**Language: Objective-C**

Here it is. The long awaited native SDK for [Parse](https://www.parse.com/products/ios). Not there are no excuses left not to give it a go on your next project.

Also note the amazing title of the first commit: `(„Å£Àò‚ñΩÀò)„Å£ ‚òÅÔ∏è ‚äÇ(‚óï„ÄÇ‚óï‚äÇ)`

Checkout [ParseUI-iOS](https://github.com/ParsePlatform/ParseUI-iOS) for a collection of a handy user interface components to be used with the SDK.

## [SwiftDataStructures](https://github.com/oisdk/SwiftDataStructures)

**Language: Swift**

Some commonly used data structures implemented in Swift. In particular Deque, Stack, List and Trie. Very instructive project.

## [SkyRadiusView](https://github.com/skytoup/SkyRadiusView)

**Language: Objective-C**

An handy `IBDesignable` view with configurable and toggable corner radius.

## [Decodable](https://github.com/Anviking/Decodable)

(Yet another) Swift JSON parser. Decodable is written in Swift 2, and has a nice API:

```swift
truct Repository {
    let name: String
    let language: String?
    let owner: User // Struct conforming to Decodable
    let defaultBranch: Branch // Struct NOT conforming to Decodable
}

extension Repository: Decodable {
    static func decode(j: AnyObject) throws -> Repository {
        return try Repository(
                    name: j => "name",
                    language: j => "language",
                    owner: j => "owner",
                    defaultBranch: Branch(name: j => "default_branch")
                )
    }
}
```

Of particularly interest the provided error type:

```swift
public enum DecodingError {
    public struct Info {
        var path: [String]
        var object: AnyObject?
        var rootObject: AnyObject? // Not implemented yet
    }

    case MissingKey(key: String, info: Info)
    case TypeMismatch(type: Any.Type, info: Info)
}
```

## [NaughtyKeyboard](https://github.com/Palleas/NaughtyKeyboard)

[The Big List of Naughty Strings](https://github.com/minimaxir/big-list-of-naughty-strings) is a list of strings which have a high probability of causing issues when used as user-input data. This is a keyboard to help you test your app from your iOS device.

This is definitely a tool to keep in mind for the pre-release polishing stage.

## [PullToBounce](https://github.com/entotsu/PullToBounce)

An animated pull to refresh component, with a bouncy effect. A very good idea to add a playful touch to your lists.

## [SwiftyDispatch](https://github.com/siuying/SwiftyDispatch)

**Language: Swift**

A lightweight GDC wrapper. Look at this neat syntax:

```swift
// Create a concurrent queue
let queue = Queue("Concurrent", .Concurrent)

// asynchronously
queue.async {
  data = true
}

queue.apply(0.3) {
  // run after 0.3 seconds
}

// It handle semaphores too

let queue = Queue("sample")
let semaphore = Semaphore(0)
queue.after(1.0) {
  print "Hello"
  semaphore.signal
}
semaphore.wait // -> true
```

## [PennyPincher](https://github.com/fe9lix/PennyPincher)

**Language: Objective-C**

[Penny Pincher](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2788925&dl=ACM&coll=DL&CFID=537151430&CFTOKEN=33011017) is a fast template-based gesture recognizer, developed by Eugene Taranta and Joseph LaViola. The demo below explains what this library does better that I could:
