Loads of new interesting projects this week. Let's get started:

## [R.swift](https://github.com/mac-cain13/R.swift)

**Language: Swift**

R is a tool to get strong typed, autocompleted resources like images, cells and segues in Swift. Instead of using brittle strings references you can now write:

```swift
R.image.settingsIcon
R.segue.openSettingsSegue
R.storyboard.main.loginController
```

## [FillableLoaders](https://github.com/poolqf/FillableLoaders)

**Language: Swift**

Collection of completely customizable progress based loaders drawn using custom `CGPaths`.

## [Material Controls for iOS](https://github.com/fpt-software/Material-Controls-For-iOS)

**Language: Objective-C**

A complete collection of UI components resembling Android's Material Design style. I personally wouldn't make an iOS app with a full Material Design look and feel, but these are certainly nice looking controls, and I wouldn't mind adding one or two to my apps.

Here's an example:

Checkout the project's [README](https://github.com/fpt-software/Material-Controls-For-iOS#component-list) for a complete list.

## [Interstellar](https://github.com/JensRavens/Interstellar)

**Language: Swift**

Simple and lightweight [Functional Reactive Coding](https://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754). Unlike other FRP frameworks like [ReactiveCocoa](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa) or [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift), Interstellar provides only the minimum viable components to build application in a reactive way: a `Signal` implementing `map`, `bind`, etc., and `Result` and `Threading` to create operations with it.

## [KVOController](https://github.com/facebook/KVOController)

**Language: Objective-C**

Key-value observing, or KVO, is a particularly useful technique for communicating between layers in a Model-View-Controller application. But the API provided by Apple are not very friendly to use. KVOController simplifies KVO by providing a simpler API and among other things blocks support and thread-safetiness.

## [Ji](https://github.com/honghaoz/Ji)

**Language: Swift**

A wrapper on libxml2 for parsing XML/HTML.

## [HackerNews](https://github.com/amitburst/HackerNews)

**Language: Swift**

A [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/news) reader iOS app written in Swift. It is always good to read other people app's code, and see how they architect things. And if you want a comparison, have a look at [Marco Sero's HackerNews client](https://github.com/MarcoSero/HackerNews), build using [ReactiveCocoa](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa) and [ComponentKit](http://componentkit.org/).

Speaking of open source apps, [Artsy](http://artsy.github.io/) just released [Energy](https://github.com/artsy/energy).

## [VideoSplash](https://github.com/toygard/VideoSplash)

**Language: Swift**

A `UIViewController` subclass exposing a simple API to display a fullscreen video.

## [New Carthage Release](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/releases/tag/0.8)

## Other Interesting Projects

* [Spacetime](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/spacetime), individually transform parts of layers in real time.
* [NYAlertViewController](https://github.com/nealyoung/NYAlertViewController), highly configurable iOS Alert Views with custom content views.
* [Forgeries](https://github.com/ashfurrow/Forgeries), helper methods for testing iOS gesture recognizers.
* [Swinject](https://github.com/Swinject/Swinject) Dependency injection framework for Swift.
* [Localize-Swift](https://github.com/marmelroy/Localize-Swift) localization and i18n with in-app language switching.
* [PrecentEncoder](https://github.com/tasanobu/PercentEncoder) lightweight library to escape string using so called URL encoding in Swift.
* [Moya](https://github.com/Moya/Moya), a network abstraction layer built on to of [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire).
