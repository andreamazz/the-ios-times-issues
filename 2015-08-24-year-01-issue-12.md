## [Cheeta](https://github.com/suguru/Cheetah)

**Language: Swift**

Cheetah is an animation utility on iOS with Swift. Cheetah can animate any properties since Cheetah uses simple CADisplayLink run loop to change animated properties.

```swift
view.cheetah
  .move(100, 0).rotate(M_PI)
  .wait()
  .move(-100, 0).rotate(-M_PI)
  .wait(1.0) // <- wait 1 sec to start next animation
  .move(0, -20).duration(0.4)
  .wait()
  .move(0, 20).duration(0.4)
  .run()
```

## [Faker](https://github.com/kleiram/Faker)

**Language: Swift**

A fake data generator. Simple to use and pretty useful when added to unit tests code.

```swift
Faker.Uuid.uuid()

let word : String         = Faker.Lorem.word()
let words : [String]      = Faker.Lorem.words()
let sentence : String     = Faker.Lorem.sentence()

Faker.Internet.url()

Int.random()

UIColor.random() 
UIImage.random()
```

## [Popover](https://github.com/corin8823/Popover)

**Language: Swift**

A popover library inspired by the Facebook app.

## [Gloss](https://github.com/hkellaway/Gloss)

**Language: Swift**

Gloss is a Swift JSON library with a curious custom operator: `~~>`.

```swift
struct RepoOwner: Decodable {
    let ownerId: Int
    let username: String?

    init?(json: JSON) {
        guard let ownerId: Int = "id" <~~ json
            else { return nil }

        self.ownerId = ownerId
        self.username = "login" <~~ json
    }
}
```

_I wonder for how long I can keep releasing issues of The iOS Times with a new Swift JSON library? ðŸ˜¬_

## [Swift-SyncAsync](https://github.com/Kametrixom/Swift-SyncAsync)

**Language: Swift**

A library to switch between sync and async tasks. The author specifies that this library is suitable for some special cases for example to try async libraries in a Playground.

## [RACPhotos](https://github.com/alexito4/RACPhotos)

**Language: Swift**

A wrapper around the Photos.framework, written using [ReactiveCocoa 3](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa).

## [TKSwarmAlert](https://github.com/entotsu/TKSwarmAlert)

**Language: Swift**

An animation library for alerts like the ones in the Swarm app. The animated demo for this library is quite heavy, so is not linked here, but you can see it in the [README](https://github.com/entotsu/TKSwarmAlert#screenshot) of course.

## [react-native-tableview](https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-tableview)

**Language: Javascript (ðŸ˜³)**

A React Native implementation of `UITableView`. Since being iOS developers most of the times means being table view developers, we are all quite familiar with those. Having a look at a familiar construct in a different language or framework is a good way to understand the new way of working. Have a look at it.

## [hit](https://github.com/czechboy0/hit)

**Language: Swift**

A (work in progress) Fulltext search library.

## [GitUp](https://github.com/git-up/GitUp)

**Langauge: Objective-C**

A GUI for Git. I am something of a terminal geek, writing this from Vim in iTerm 2, so it doesn't seem very appealing to me, but it is indeed an interesting app.

And speaking of interesting apps, [ChitChat](https://github.com/stonesam92/ChitChat) is an open source app that wraps the WhatsApp web interface for iOS users.

## Other interesting projects

* [TKAnimatedCheckButton](https://github.com/entotsu/TKAnimatedCheckButton) animated Check Button.
* [SwiftSpace](https://github.com/FlexMonkey/SwiftSpace) gyroscope Driven Drawing in 3D Space.
* [WAAppRouting](https://github.com/Wasappli/WAAppRouting) a routing library specially useful to deal with stacks of controllers.
* [MeshPipe](https://github.com/nevyn/MeshPipe) inter-process-communication framework to allow multiple apps to send data to each other using [UDP networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol).

## Still hot from last week ðŸ”¥

Just in case you missed them, these projects have been _hot_ for a couple of weeks already:

* [FillableLoaders](https://github.com/poolqf/FillableLoaders) completely customizable progress based loaders drawn using custom `CGPaths`.
* [NaughtyKeyboard](https://github.com/Palleas/NaughtyKeyboard) the Big List of Naughty Strings is a list of strings which have a high probability of causing issues when used as user-input data. This is a keyboard to help you test your app from your iOS device.
* [PullToBounce](https://github.com/entotsu/PullToBounce) animated "Pull To Refresh" Library for `UIScrollView`.
