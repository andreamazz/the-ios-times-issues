## [Poppins](https://github.com/thoughtbot/Poppins)

[Thoughtbot](https://www.thoughtbot.com) opensourced another iOS app. Poppins, which you can [download from the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/poppins/id978854068?mt=8) is a app to store and share GIFs. You should definitely browse through this source to see some examples of MVVM architecture, and functional programming applied to real world iOS development.

**Language: Swift**

A nice image processing library.

```swift
Toucan(image: myImage).maskWithEllipse().image

Toucan(image: portraitImage).resize(CGSize(width: 500, height: 500), fitMode: Toucan.Resize.FitMode.Crop).image

A `UITextField` subclass that comes with an _awesome_ animation effect on its placeholder.

This little custom view is configurable via Interface Builder, thanks to `IBDesignable` and `IBInspecatble`. And if for some reason you can't use Swift, there is an [Objcetive-C version](https://github.com/NikoGenn/AwesomeTextField).
