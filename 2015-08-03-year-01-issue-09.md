Great variety of interesting libraries this week, if you are into animations, data structures, or utilities. Let's get started üòÅ.

## [PINRemoteImage](https://github.com/pinterest/PINRemoteImage)

**Language: Objective-C**

A fast, non-deadlocking parallel image downloader and cache for iOS, made by [Pintereset](https://www.pinterest.com/). It assures that if multiple requests for the same image are triggered, only the first one is actually executed, while still delivering the result to all the callers. A standout feature is an incremental download of images when on slow connections, getting a lower resolution version first.

## [iRate](https://github.com/nicklockwood/iRate)

**Language: Objective-C**

A handy class that prompts users of your iPhone or Mac App Store app to rate your application after using it for a while. It is simple to integrate it in your app, and it provides several configuration options, as well as localisation support.


## [NVActivityIndicatorView Demo](https://github.com/ninjaprox/NVActivityIndicatorView)

**Language: Swift**

A collection of loading animations. The README says _nice_, and I agree. I'll pic the Pac-Man animation on my next project for sure.

## [CarthageLicenseScript](https://github.com/pietbrauer/CarthageLicenseScript)

A little script that downloads all the licenses for the frameworks used via [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage).

## [MuseumGuide](https://github.com/larcus94/MuseumGuide)

**Languae: Swift**

A small framework that makes `UIImage` accessible. It generates accessible labels to describe given images. It does so by extracting the [exif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchangeable_image_file_format) payload and doing some basic image processing.

## [GuillotineMenu](https://github.com/Yalantis/GuillotineMenu)

**Language: Swift**

Apple has clearly stated that [they don't like hamburger menus](http://blog.manbolo.com/2014/06/30/apple-on-hamburger-menus), nevertheless this implementation is an original one.

## [CKWaveCollectionViewTransition](https://github.com/CezaryKopacz/CKWaveCollectionViewTransition)

**Language: Swift**

A beautiful transition between two or more `UICollectionView`s. It is very good looking, but is it gonna get in the user's way after the first wow moments?

## [CrackingTheCodingInterview](https://github.com/bizz84/CrackingTheCodingInterview)

**Language: Swift**

A collection of Playgrounds with solutions to the exercises from the [Cracking the Coding Interview]() book. A good way to challenge yourself and compare the resulting implementation with the one from the Playground's author.

## Text effects

[LTMorphingLabel](https://github.com/lexrus/LTMorphingLabel) and [TextFieldEffects](https://github.com/raulriera/TextFieldEffects) are two libraries to checkout if you are looking to add some nice animation effect to the labels and text inputs of your app.

## JSON Parsing

**Language: Swift**

If you need to easily parse data returned by a JSON API into models you should checkout [SwiftyJSON](https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON), [ObjectMapper](https://github.com/Hearst-DD/ObjectMapper), and [Argo](https://github.com/thoughtbot/Argo).

## Other interesting projects

* [SwiftStructures](https://github.com/waynewbishop/SwiftStructures) Examples of commonly used data structures and algorithms in Swift.
* [SwiftDate](https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftDate) a framework to simplify `NSDate` management in Swift.
* [pangu.objective-c](https://github.com/Cee/pangu.objective-c) paranoid auto spacing, automatically insert whitespace between CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean), half-width English, digit and symbol characters.
* [CoreMeteor](https://github.com/malcolmhall/CoreMeteor) combines the Meteor Javascript client with the best of Core Data to create a _truly magical_ native iOS experience.
* [planck](https://github.com/mfikes/planck) ClojureScript REPL for OS X.
